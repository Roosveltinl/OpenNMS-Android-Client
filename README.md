## Building application

Latest version of Android Studio is recommended.

### Requirements
* Gradle
* Android SDK with build tools and support repository

Before doing anything you should set an environment variable called `ANDROID_HOME` pointing to Android SDK location.
After installing and configuring everything **run `assemble` build task**. This task will produce APK output located at `build/apk`.

More information about new build system is available on [Android Tools website](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide).
